# Vortex Video v0.0.1

---

Vortex aims to be a video hosting platform in competition with Youtube, but with much better policies and services.   
Some of these include:   
 - A non intrusive algorithm   
 - Much more power given to creators over things like ads   
 - A much looser content guideline system that still blocks actually harmful content, not "guns with magazines of over 10 rounds" like Youtube   
 - A system in which all users are notified of changes at least a week before they release, and creators are given a vote on whether the change should be kept, modified, or discarded, both before and after the change is released.
