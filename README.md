# Vortex Video v0.0.1

---

Vortex aims to be a video hosting platform in competition with Youtube, but with much better policies and services.   
Some of these include:   
 - A non intrusive algorithm   
 - Much more power given to creators over things like ads   
 - A much looser content guideline system that still blocks actually harmful content, not "guns with magazines of over 10 rounds" like Youtube   
 - A system in which all users are notified of changes at least a week before they release, and creators are given a vote on whether the change should be kept, modified, or discarded, both before and after the change is released.

### How to get involved

Join the Vortex Development Discord at https://discord.gg/5zWxzwAukj and send a message in the #applications channel with your qualifications, why you want to help out, etc. If I think you're a good fit, I'll add you to the team.   
Currently I have no funding for this, but if I can get enough support hopefully I'll be able to turn this into a real company and start hiring actual developers, maybe even some of you guys if you're up for that.   

We currently need (in order of importance):

 - HTML/CSS developers
 - Javascript developers
 - developers who can do something relating to websites and video hosting and such, I dont know exactly what's best but if you do then let me know.
 - Someone who can handle server stuff so we can actually make this a website
 - Someone who knows how to use databases (SQL/SQLite? I've never used databases before)
 - Art Designers

### Who am I?

I'm currently taking college classes in various different programming languages, including HTML/CSS. I'm sick of Youtube getting away with everything because they're the only good video platform, so I wanna change that.   

Obviously I'm pretty underqualified for something of this scale at the moment, but I'm trying to learn as fast as I can. Most of my code is gonna be super inefficient and garbage since I literally started HTML/CSS/JS last week, so if you see anything like that just let me know and give me a way to fix it and I'll make it better.   

Also, as a bunch of different people I've met have said, "An employer is hiring you to do something better than they can." It's a little different since I wouldn't be exactly hiring you, but you get the point. You'll probably be way better than me at whatever you join the team to do, which is why I want you to join the team.   

If you want an idea of what my work looks like, just check out some of the other stuff I've uploaded to github.
